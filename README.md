# About
This is where I keep my rc files, vim settings and anything else that I like
to have configured in Ubuntu. There are some traces of windows configuration
for cygwin but that was a long, long time ago in a platform far away.

# What it does
It goes through all the files in the repo and creates symbolic links for each
one - usually in the home folder but it also move local bin files, etc. This
allow me to share my settings across multiple machines and not lose them if my
laptop explodes.

# Installation

```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

# TODO
- Install monaco font
- Create vim backup/swap directories
- install pip
- pip install powerline-status
